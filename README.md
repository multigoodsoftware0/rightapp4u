# what is this?

Rightapp4u is a shameless clone of appsumo.com but for professionals in India. It uses Rails 6, MySQL, & Razorpay, and was launched in 2019. The project failed miserably after being marketed for 18 months to more than 100,000 professionals all over India. So, we decided to make it open source to showcase our Ruby on Rails skillsets.

# tech stack

- Rails6
- MySQL / SQLite
- Razorpay

# what next?

- not much but if you want us to build a MVP for you in Ruby on Rails v8+ then you can visit our [website](https://bestwebventures.in/).
